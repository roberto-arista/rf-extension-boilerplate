# Boilerplate RoboFont Extension

This is a dummy RoboFont extension to demonstrate the [Extension Folder Structure].

[Extension Folder Structure]: http://robofont.com/documentation/building-tools/extensions/extension-file-spec/#extension-folder-structure

If you are starting your own extension, you can use this example as a template.
